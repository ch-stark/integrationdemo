Deployment Structure: TBD


When use Gitops flow
When use BPM

For example a User does a Commit which triggers a tekton pipeline which deploys the Application to staging but
this is not enough.
When it comes to production a Kogito Process should be invoked which requires two Manual Approvals.


Scoping of the Topics TBD
All (apart ArgoCD has VSCode extensions)
